        <strong>College life</strong>
        is more interesting than high school, but more challenging since when I was in High School my
        Academic Strand is <strong>TVL-Agriculture</strong> which is not good to this kind of course i have right now.
        Since The <strong>Passerelles Numeriques</strong> give me a
        chance to have new set of life, and I grab this opportunity. Since I am not really know what should the IT can
        do to the industry and what
        should do IT can do to my life. And a whole life that i have before i enter in PN, really dont have any
        background in computer.
        And also im not a kind of a person who can easily understand especially in logic which is really need to this
        kind of course. But instead of giving up,
        i always bear in my mind that i am here in PN because of my family and to my dreams. In that way, I learned how
        to accept IT industry to my life and
        to love it. And PN also give not just good in Academic but also they teach how to act professionally and also
        being independent. And also, i build my confidence
        in a way of talking to stranges and ask more question which is connect to the <strong>confidence hack</strong>
        in PN subject. And
        also my confidence more develops in joining <strong>Miss Gay</strong>
        in PN. That is one of my unforgetable moments in my college life.

        IT for me right now is not easy to study, since I already here and my dreams depend on it. And i beleive in this
        saying <strong> “There is no failure except in no longer trying.” - Chris Bradford</strong>.
        that qoutes serve as my foundation every obstacles that i encounter in my life. And i beleive in myself that i
        can make it, can do everything especially in <strong>PROGRAMING</strong> since it should have critical thinking
        and have more logic so that you
        really solve the sample problem that you find a solution.
    <p>
        In this college life i should give the best all I can do so that i can pass so that my parents proud of me. Also
        college life need more focus and have time management in everything you do in every hour, minute, seconds, day
        week, months or year.
